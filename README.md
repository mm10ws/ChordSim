files:
-project3.scala

usage:
scala project3 numNodes numRequests


What is working:
The node joins and finger table calulations work correctly. 
The routing/request messages seem to be working correctly, However, there seems to be an incresed chance of failure/incorrect results after 100 nodes. 

Largest network:
~500 nodes
